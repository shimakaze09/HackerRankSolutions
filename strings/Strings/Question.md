# Strings
C++ provides a nice alternative data type to manipulate strings, and the data type is conveniently called string.
Some of its widely used features are the following:
- Declaration:
`string a = "abc";`
- Size:
`int len = a.size();`
- Concatenate two strings:
`string a = "abc";`
`string b = "def";`
`string c = a + b; // c = "abcdef".`
- Accessing *i*<sup>*th*</sup> element:
`string s = "abc";`
`char   c0 = s[0];   // c0 = 'a'`
`char   c1 = s[1];   // c1 = 'b'`
`char   c2 = s[2];   // c2 = 'c'`

`s[0] = 'z';         // s = "zbc"`

**P.S.**: We will use cin/cout to read/write a string.
